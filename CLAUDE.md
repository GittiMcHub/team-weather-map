## Project: Team Weather Map

A zero-dependency, single-file web dashboard showing live weather for team office locations worldwide.

**The entire application lives in one file: `ClaudeDesignStandalone.html`.**

### Tech Stack

| Concern | Solution |
|---|---|
| UI framework | React 18.3.1 (hooks: useState, useEffect, useRef, useCallback) |
| Maps | Leaflet + OpenStreetMap/CartoDB tiles |
| Weather data | Open-Meteo API (free, no API key required) |
| Persistence | Browser `localStorage` |
| Bundling | Custom base64/gzip bundle embedded in `<script>` tags |

### How to Run

Open `ClaudeDesignStandalone.html` directly in a browser. No server, no `npm install`, no build step.

### Architecture: Single-File Bundle

The HTML file uses a custom runtime bundler: assets (JS, CSS, images) are stored as base64-encoded, gzip-compressed data in `<script type="__bundler/manifest">` and `<script type="__bundler/template">` tags. On `DOMContentLoaded`, the bootstrap script in `<head>` decodes and decompresses them via the `DecompressionStream` API, then creates Blob URLs and injects the real app into the page.

**Consequence for editing:** All application logic is inside the bundle data — do not edit raw base64 blobs directly. Instead, locate the React component source within the decoded bundle or reconstruct the relevant section as readable JSX/TS and re-embed it.

### Key Application Areas

- **Today tab** — tile grid per city: current max temperature + weather condition icon.
- **Weekend tab** — looks back at last Saturday & Sunday; shows a "vibe" summary emoji/label.
- **Map tab** — Leaflet map with per-city markers: weather icon, temperature, team member avatars.
- **Team management** — add members, assign city, pick avatar colour, upload/crop profile photo or paste URL.
- **City/layout settings** — add/remove cities with custom lat/lon, configure grid columns per breakpoint, toggle city name position.

### Current State (as of 2026-04-30)

- No automated tests exist yet. The 80% coverage target in the guidelines below is the goal, not the current state.
- No CI pipeline configured yet.
- No `/docs` folder exists yet — must be created when work begins on any non-trivial feature.

### Commit Convention (project-specific examples)

```
add | weekend vibe tab with Saturday/Sunday weather summary
fix | map markers not updating when city lat/lon changes
change | increase localStorage key prefix to avoid collisions
refactor | extract weather fetch logic into composable
```

# Agnostic Software Development Guidelines

> **Purpose:** This document governs how an agentic coding assistant must plan, implement, document, and deliver software. It is language-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and applies to every project unless explicitly overridden by a project-specific configuration.

---

## 0 · Prime Directive — Identify, Ask, Document

Before writing any code the agent **must** follow this loop:

1. **Identify missing information.** Scan the request, existing codebase, and `/docs` folder. Flag every gap: unclear domain terms, missing API specs, unknown deployment targets, ambiguous acceptance criteria.
2. **Ask targeted questions.** Do not assume. Present the user with specific, bounded questions (ideally as selectable options) and wait for answers.
3. **Document decisions immediately.** Every answered question becomes a record — in the glossary, an ADR, the domain model, or inline code comments. Decisions must never live only in chat history.

> **Rule:** No feature branch may be opened until steps 1–3 have been completed for the work item in scope.

---

## 1 · Documentation Requirements

Every project repository **must** contain a `/docs` folder with the following structure. The agent must create stub files on project initialisation and keep them current as the project evolves.

```
/docs
├── system-context.md            # 1a
├── domain-model.md              # 1b
├── glossary.md                  # 1c
├── adr/                         # 1d
│   ├── ADR-000-template.md
│   └── ...
├── third-party-inventory.md     # 1e
├── security.md                  # 1f
├── personas.md                  # 1g  (optional)
└── use-cases.md                 # 1h  (optional)
```

### 1a · System Context (`system-context.md`)

Separates the system under development from its neighbouring systems. This is one of the most critical tasks in requirements analysis.

**Must contain:**

- A high-level context diagram (text-based, e.g., Mermaid or PlantUML) showing the system boundary and all external actors/systems.
- For **every** neighbouring system or external actor:
    - Name and owner
    - Communication protocol (REST, gRPC, message queue, file drop, etc.)
    - Data format (JSON, Protobuf, CSV, XML, etc.)
    - Authentication/authorisation mechanism
    - Direction of data flow (inbound, outbound, bidirectional)
    - SLA or availability expectations (if known)
    - Error handling contract (retries, dead-letter queues, circuit breakers)
- A responsibility matrix clarifying which team/system owns which interface.

**Agent behaviour:** If any interface is not fully specified, the agent must ask the user to clarify before proceeding with implementation that depends on it.

### 1b · Domain Model (`domain-model.md`)

Describes the domain of the project using domain-driven design concepts.

**Must contain:**

- **Entities** — objects with identity and lifecycle.
- **Value Objects** — immutable objects defined by their attributes.
- **Associations** — relationships between entities, including cardinality.
- **Domain Events** — state transitions or facts that other parts of the system react to.
- **Modules / Bounded Contexts** — logical groupings and explicit boundaries.
- A visual domain model diagram (Mermaid, PlantUML, or similar text-based notation).

**Agent behaviour:** When the agent encounters a new domain concept during implementation, it must update the domain model before continuing.

### 1c · Glossary (`glossary.md`)

A living dictionary of all technical and specialist terms, abbreviations, and acronyms relevant to the project.

**Format:**

```markdown
| Term             | Definition                                          | Source / Context       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Bounded Context  | A logical boundary within the domain model ...      | Domain-Driven Design   |
| PII              | Personally Identifiable Information ...              | Security / GDPR        |
```

**Agent behaviour:** Whenever the agent encounters an undefined term — in user requests, code, or documentation — it must add it to the glossary. If the meaning is ambiguous, ask the user first.

### 1d · Architectural Decision Records (`adr/`)

Each ADR captures **why** a decision was made, not just what was decided.

**Template (`ADR-000-template.md`):**

```markdown
# ADR-{NNN}: {Title}

- **Status:** proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-{NNN}
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Deciders:** {people or roles involved}

## Context

What is the issue that motivates this decision?

## Decision

What is the change that is being proposed or has been agreed upon?

## Design Patterns Used

Which software design patterns are applied and why?

## Consequences

### Positive
- ...

### Negative
- ...

### Risks
- ...

## Alternatives Considered

| Alternative         | Pros              | Cons              | Reason Rejected       |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| ...                 | ...               | ...               | ...                   |
```

**Agent behaviour:** The agent must create an ADR for every non-trivial architectural decision — choice of framework, data store, communication pattern, authentication strategy, design pattern, etc. — **before** implementing it.

### 1e · Third-Party Inventory (`third-party-inventory.md`)

All third-party tools, libraries, and services must be tracked.

**Required fields per dependency:**

```markdown
| Dependency        | Version  | Latest Available | License    | License Impact          | Risk Level | Notes / Justification              |
|-------------------|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------------|------------|------------------------------------|
| express           | 4.18.2   | 4.19.0           | MIT        | Permissive, no concern  | Low        | HTTP framework                     |
| libsodium         | 0.7.13   | 0.7.15           | ISC        | Permissive, no concern  | Low        | Encryption primitives              |
| some-gpl-lib      | 2.1.0    | 2.1.0            | GPL-3.0    | Copyleft — taints dist. | High       | Evaluate alternatives              |
```

**Required assessments:**

- **Currency:** Is the dependency actively maintained? When was the last release?
- **License:** What license applies? Does it impose obligations (copyleft, attribution, patent clauses)?
- **License impact:** Does the license conflict with the project's distribution model?
- **Risk evaluation:** Considering maintenance status, security history, community size, and license — Low / Medium / High.

**Agent behaviour:** Whenever the agent adds a dependency, it must update this inventory immediately. The agent should prefer dependencies with permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD) unless instructed otherwise.

**Automation goal:** The project should include a script or CI step that can regenerate or validate this inventory automatically (e.g., using `license-checker`, `pip-licenses`, `cargo-license`, or equivalent).

### 1f · Security (`security.md`)

Security documentation based on the combined recommendations of OWASP, AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar, GCP Security Best Practices, CIS Benchmarks, and ISO 27001/27002.

**Must address:**

- **Data at rest:** Encryption standards (AES-256 or equivalent), key management strategy, storage provider configuration.
- **Data in transit:** TLS requirements (minimum TLS 1.2, prefer 1.3), certificate management, mTLS where applicable.
- **Network security:** Network segmentation, firewall rules, ingress/egress controls, VPC/VNet configuration.
- **Infrastructure security:** Hardening baselines (CIS Benchmarks), patching strategy, immutable infrastructure preferences.
- **Identity and Access Management:** Authentication mechanisms, authorisation model (RBAC/ABAC), service-to-service identity.
- **Threat model:** Key threats identified and mitigations planned (STRIDE or equivalent framework).
- **Incident response:** Logging, monitoring, alerting, and escalation plan outline.
- **Compliance:** Applicable regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, etc.) and how the system addresses them.

**Agent behaviour:** The agent must consider security implications for every feature and raise concerns proactively. Security is never deferred to "later."

### 1g · Personas (`personas.md`) — *Optional*

Prototypical users of the system with characteristics that help the team empathise with real users.

**Per persona:**

- Name, photo description, demographic summary
- Role and relationship to the system
- Goals and motivations
- Frustrations and pain points
- Technical proficiency level
- Key scenarios they perform in the system

### 1h · Use Cases (`use-cases.md`) — *Optional*

Business-oriented descriptions of how users interact with the system.

**Per use case:**

- **ID and title**
- **Primary actor**
- **Preconditions**
- **Main success scenario** (numbered steps)
- **Alternative flows / extensions**
- **Postconditions**
- **Business rules** referenced

---

## 2 · Architecture Principles

These principles apply to all design and implementation decisions.

### 2a · Non-Blocking Communication

Prefer asynchronous, non-blocking communication between systems to achieve technical autonomy.

- Use message queues, event streams, or webhooks over synchronous HTTP calls where feasible.
- When synchronous communication is necessary, apply timeouts, circuit breakers, retries with exponential backoff, and bulkheads.
- Document the communication pattern chosen and the rationale in an ADR.

### 2b · Small and Simple

Services should be small, focused, and aligned with business capabilities.

- Design around bounded contexts from the domain model.
- Each service encapsulates its own state and behaviour.
- Avoid shared databases between services.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Favour explicit over implicit — readability over cleverness.

### 2c · Security by Design (OWASP Principles)

Security is embedded at every layer. The following principles are non-negotiable:

| Principle                     | Meaning                                                                                                |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minimise attack surface       | Restrict exposed functions; disable or remove unused endpoints, features, and ports.                   |
| Establish secure defaults     | Systems must be secure out of the box; users opt-in to less secure configurations, never the reverse.  |
| Principle of least privilege   | Every component, user, and service gets only the minimum permissions required.                          |
| Defence in depth              | Multiple independent layers of security; no single point of failure.                                    |
| Fail securely                 | Failures must not grant additional privileges or leak sensitive data.                                  |
| Don't trust services          | Always validate data received from third parties and external systems.                                  |
| Fix security issues correctly | Apply proper fixes; no workarounds. Root-cause analysis is mandatory.                                  |

### 2d · Secure Coding Guidelines

The agent must adopt the **OWASP Developer Guide** as the baseline for secure coding. This includes but is not limited to:

- Input validation (allowlisting over denylisting)
- Output encoding
- Parameterised queries (no string concatenation for SQL/LDAP/OS commands)
- Proper error handling (no stack traces in production responses)
- Secure session management
- Cryptographic best practices (no custom crypto, use vetted libraries)
- Logging sensitive operations without logging sensitive data (no PII, tokens, or secrets in logs)

---

## 3 · Implementation Requirements

### 3a · Test-Driven Development

- **Target test coverage: 80% minimum** (line coverage).
- Write tests **before** or alongside production code, never as an afterthought.
- Every user-facing feature must have at least one **automated acceptance test or end-to-end test**.
- Test types and their scope:

| Test Type        | Scope                         | When Run                     |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Unit Tests       | Single function / class       | Always (every build)         |
| Acceptance Tests | Feature / user story          | Always (every build)         |
| End-to-End Tests | Full system flow              | Release builds only          |
| Integration Tests| Service boundary interactions | As needed per architecture   |

- Tests must be deterministic, isolated, and fast. Flaky tests are treated as bugs.

### 3b · Design Patterns

- Use established software design patterns (Gang of Four, enterprise patterns, domain-driven design patterns) where they reduce complexity.
- **Every pattern used must be:**
    1. Named explicitly in a code comment or doc at the point of use.
    2. Documented in the relevant ADR explaining why it was chosen and what problem it solves.
- Do not force patterns where simple procedural code suffices.

### 3c · Code Versioning

- **Platform:** Git with GitHub.
- **Commit message convention:** `type | descriptive message`
    - Allowed types: `fix`, `add`, `change`, `refactor`
    - Examples:
        - `add | user authentication via OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow`
        - `fix | null pointer on empty cart checkout`
        - `change | increase session timeout to 30 minutes`
        - `refactor | extract payment gateway adapter interface`
- All build steps must be runnable in **GitHub Actions**.
- Branch protection: `main` / `release` branches require PR review and passing CI.

### 3d · Required Build Steps

All build tooling must be **free and/or open-source**. Builds must be runnable **locally** and **optionally via GitHub Actions**.

## 4 · Agent Workflow Summary

The agent must follow this sequence for every task:

```
1. RECEIVE task/request
       │
2. ANALYSE — read existing /docs, codebase, and context
       │
3. IDENTIFY GAPS — what information is missing?
       │
4. ASK — present specific questions to the user
       │
5. DOCUMENT — record answers in the appropriate /docs file or ADR
       │
6. PLAN — outline approach, identify design patterns, consider security
       │
7. IMPLEMENT — write tests first, then production code
       │
8. VERIFY — run the full local build pipeline
       │
9. COMMIT — using the prescribed commit message format
       │
10. UPDATE DOCS — ensure all /docs files reflect the changes made
```

**If at any point the agent discovers that documentation is missing, outdated, or contradicts the implementation, it must stop and reconcile the discrepancy before continuing.**

---

## 5 · Quick Reference — Agent Checklist

Before completing any task, the agent must confirm:

- [ ] All missing information has been identified and clarified with the user.
- [ ] All decisions have been documented (glossary, ADR, domain model, or system context).
- [ ] Security implications have been considered and documented.
- [ ] Third-party dependencies added are recorded in the inventory with license and risk assessment.

*This file is the source of truth for development practices. It must be version-controlled and updated whenever project conventions evolve.*
